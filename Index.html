<p> <big> About me </big> - <b> I am currently pursuing my engineering degree in Information Technology from Jaypee University of Institute technology, Solan, HP,173234. I love and enjoy meeting strangers and interacting with them through words and learning about their views and perspective in every field as far as possible. Sometimes I think of myself as an information junkie because I am always curious to know more and more as far as possible. I am full of questions like when, why, how, where etc. This makes me detailed oriented to. I am a critical thinker. As I do positive overthinking very often, it helps me learns pros and cons of different situations and things. As I have written earlier that I am curious about things, so my curiosity leads my interest in exploring stuffs which is also my hobby. I am an IT student so nowadays coding is getting all my attention and curiosity which is making my interest exponentially up towards it. Sometimes I write to such as philosopher lines etc. I also love writing down my views and opinions that keeps running on my mind.</b></p>
